# UFO

## Overview of the Project

The purpose of this project is to provide to the larger public all information relating to UFO ("Unidentified Flying Objects") sightings. The program is conducted by a fictive person named Dana, a researcher of everything related to UFOs. A website will be built to allow the public to query UFO related information and we will use Javascript and HTML to build it. 

## Results

The following filters were added to provide several options to pull data.

In addition, since there are many filters, we thought it would be more convenient to allow the user to clear all and reset all the filters. This would , in turn make it easier to search the website for information rather than spending times doing unecessary clean-up before accessing information.

## Summary

The website is a good idea as it is a "one stop shop" for all information on UFO sightings. It allows easy access to information which should aloow the public to get information on their own without anyone filtering what they should or shouldnt know. 

Additional work and tweaks still remain to get done.  For instance, 

 + 1. it will prove important to identify the cource for the information being provided. This would add to the credibility of the data. 
 + 2. Placeholder information should be dynamic and disapear after data is queried based on one the filters.
          for instance, state entered is "ca". yet, there seems to remain info in the other filters eventhough they are related to the output.

 + 3. The filter reset key should be positioned next to the filters , at the bottom in the same area where the filers are located and make it simple. simply call is "reset key or click here for next search  such as

+ 4. It's important that input data not be case sensitive. For instance if the state of California is entered as "CA" instead of "ca", there is no output. That's incorrect and misleading as there is data for California. Finally 

+ 5. Going back to the credibility topic on point #1, I would have the website linked to local newspapeSr via API.This would further add credibility to all information reported by others and which the website is relaying.
