# UFO

## Overview of the Project

The purpose of this project is to provide to the larger all information relating to UFO ("Unidentified Flying Objects") sightings. The program is conducted by a fictive person named Dana, a researcher of everything related to UFOs. A website will be built to allow the public to query UFO related information and we will use Javascript and HTML to build the website. 

## Results

The following filters were added to provide several options to pull data.

In addition, since there are many filters, we thought it would be convenient to allow the user to clear one filed and reset all the filters. This would , in turn, make it easier to serach the webesite for information rather than spending times doing unecessary clean-up before accessing information.

Below is the end result of the site

## Summary

The webiste is a good idea as it is a "one stop shop" for all information on UFO sightings. It allows easy access to information which should aloow the public to get information on their own without anyone filtering what they should know or shouldnt. 

Additional work and tweaks still remain to get done.  For instance, 

 + 1. it will prove important to identify the cource for the information being provided. This would ad to the credibility of the data. 

 + 2. The filter reset key should be position next to the filters , at the bottom in the same area where the filers are located and make it simple. simply call is "reset key or clieck here for next search

+ 3. It's important that input data not be case sensitive. for instance if state is CA instead of ca, there is no output. That's incorrect and misleading and finally 

+ 4. going to to the credibility topic on point #1, i would have the website linked to local newspaper ( API).This would further add credibility to all information reported, which the website is relaying.

The following lead to the webpage.
